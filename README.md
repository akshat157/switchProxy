# switchProxy
Small shell script made to toggle between Ubuntu proxy settings.
Made this primarily for different proxy settings in my college campus. You can modify the script according to your needs.

* Clone the repo to local machine.
* Make the file `switchProxy.sh` executable.

  ```shell
  $ chmod +x switchProxy.sh
  ```
* Move the file to any of the paths in $PATH say `/usr/bin`
* Open keyboard settings from unity launcher and create a keyboard shortcut like `Shift+Ctrl+Alt+P` with Command `switchProxy.sh` 

That's it! You can now toggle between proxy settings with a simple keyboard shortcut> :)

Although this is supposed to be a basic script for someone new to shell scripting, contributions are always welcome!
